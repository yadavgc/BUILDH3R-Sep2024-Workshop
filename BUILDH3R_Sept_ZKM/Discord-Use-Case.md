## zkMIPS for Fair RNG (Random Number Generation)
### Problem:
Random number generation (RNG) is critical for various applications like lotteries, gaming, and cryptographic protocols. However, proving that RNG is fair and unbiased without exposing the random values themselves is a challenge.

### Solution: zkMIPS-Based Fair RNG Proof
Using zkMIPS, developers can generate a cryptographic proof that an RNG process was fair and unbiased without revealing the random number itself. This ensures transparency in applications where fairness is crucial, like lotteries or gaming platforms.

- RNG Process:
  A zkMIPS program generates a random number, and simultaneously creates a proof that:
    - The random number was generated using a fair, verifiable process.
    - No external manipulation influenced the RNG result.
- Proof Verification:
  The zkMIPS proof is submitted on-chain, where a verifier contract:
    - Confirms the RNG was performed fairly.
    - Ensures no party could have influenced or known the outcome in advance.
- Use in Applications:
    Applications like decentralized lotteries, games, or cryptographic protocols can use this proof to demonstrate fairness without revealing the actual random number until necessary.

### Why zkMIPS for Fair RNG?
- Fairness: zkMIPS ensures that the RNG process is unbiased and cannot be manipulated.
- Transparency: Allows stakeholders to verify that the RNG was fair without revealing sensitive outcomes too early.
- Trust: Builds trust in decentralized lotteries or gaming applications where fairness is critical.

### Solution Components
- zkMIPS: Generates cryptographic proofs verifying fair RNG without revealing the result.
- Smart Contract: Verifies the RNG proof on-chain for fairness.
- Golang & Rust: Used to develop the zkMIPS RNG program and proof verification system.
